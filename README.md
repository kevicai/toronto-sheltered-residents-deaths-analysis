# Seasonal Variations in Mortality Rates Among Shelter Residents in Toronto: Is Winter the Deadliest Season?

## Overview

This study explores Toronto winters' influence the morality rates among sheltered residents, utilizing data from 2007-2023. I explore on how cold weather impacts those in shelters by drawing upon previous research that highlights increased risks for homeless populations during colder months. I find that mortality rates in spring, summer, and fall are similar, while winter shows a slight increase compared to the other seasons. This finding suggests while homeless shelters do help to lower the risk of death in winter, further meaures should be taken to protect sheltered individuals against cold weather.
